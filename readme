Tools for conflating and importing the Microsoft building data available at
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microsoft_Building_Footprint_Data .

Requires Python 3 and python-gdal with GEOS support. The R script requires R!

fetch.py
-------------

Retrieves current OpenStreetMap buildings from Overpass API. Takes an
Overpass QL style bounding box and output file name as input:

    python fetch.py 42.312,-83.096,42.386,-83.007 detroit_buildings.osm


stats.py
------------

Calculates overlap between existing OSM buildings and Bing buildings. Input, in 
order, the osm building file, the bing shapefile and the filename to store the output in

    python stats.py osmxml MSBuildingshp outfile


histo.R
-----------

Calculate a simple histogram from overlaps.txt


match.py
---------------
Finds OSM buildings with a large overlap with a Microsoft building and appends a 
height tag to those buildings. 

    python match.py osmxml MSBuildingshp outfile


newbuildings.py
-------------------------

Finds buildings in a Microsoft shapefile that do not overlap with existing OSM buildings
and outputs a shapefile with simplified building geometries and suitable OSM tags.

    python newbuildings.py detroit_buildings.osm /MS_buildings_michigan/ newbuildings


Example Session
-------------------------

Starting with the Microsoft data for Michigan stored in `/share/gis/MS_buildings_michigan/`.

    python fetch.py 42.312,-83.096,42.386,-83.007 detroit_buildings.osm
    python stats.py detroit_buildings.osm /share/gis/MS_buildings_michigan/ overlaps.txt
    Rscript histo.R
    python match.py detroit_buildings.osm /share/gis/MS_buildings_michigan/ detroit_heights.osm
    python newbuildings.py detroit_buildings.osm /share/gis/MS_buildings_michigan/ newbuildings
